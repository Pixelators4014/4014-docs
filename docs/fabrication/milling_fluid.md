<sup>a</sup> In machining aluminum, several varieties of coolants may be used. For rough machining, where the stock removal is sufficient to produce heat, water soluble mixtures can be used with good results to dissipate the heat. Other oils that may be recommended are straight mineral seal oil; a 50–50 mixture of mineral seal oil and kerosene; a mixture of 10% lard oil with 90% kerosene; and a 100-second mineral oil cut back with mineral seal oil or kerosene.

<sup>b</sup> The sulfur-base oil referred to contains 4½% sulfur compound. Base oils are usually dark in color. As a rule, they contain sulfur compounds resulting from a thermal or catalytic refinery process. When so processed, they are more suitable for industrial coolants than when they have had such compounds as flowers of sulfur added by hand. The adding of sulfur compounds by hand to the coolant reservoir is of temporary value only, and the non-uniformity of the solution may affect the machining operation.

<sup>c</sup> A soluble oil or low-viscosity mineral oil may be used in machining cast iron to prevent excessive metal dust.

<sup>d</sup> When a cutting fluid is needed for machining magnesium, low or nonacid mineral seal or lard oils are recommended. Coolants containing water should not be used because of the fire danger when magnesium chips react with water, forming hydrogen gas.
