# Parts We Use

When I first started designing for the team, I was lost on where to get materials and COTS (commercial, off-the-shelf parts) from. Before I forget, here is a guide that personally I would've found helpful. <br>
It is important to note here that any materials can be used as long as it is under $600. This document is just a place to start. 

## Normal Stock

The primary material we use in FRC is metal (i love metal fr) <br>
There are three types of metal that we usually use. 
1. Metal hollow bars - tubes that come in like 1x1 in, 2x1 in (the one we use most often). Typically have shell thickness of 1/8".
2. Metal Plates - flat piece of metal that have different thicknesses, most common being 1/8" and 1/4". Useful for stuff ig (like bellypan!)
3. Shafts - hex or D shafts, used to hold turning things ig. We get normal shafts from [West Coast Products](https://wcproducts.com/products/shaft-stock) and threaded ones from [RevRobotics](https://www.revrobotics.com/.5in-Rounded-Hex-Shafts/). 
We usually source them from [Industrial Metal Supply](https://www.industrialmetalsupply.com/products/metals/aluminum "metal place") <br>
It is important to keep in mind that we will be fabricating these things on a mill, so think abt how a mill would mill this out when fabbing. Contact design or fab lead if u have qusetion
> Protip: You can use the accessibility inspection feature in Fusion Design (in the top right corner dropdown) and click on the face you are milling from to see if all your feature can be milled. 

## Highly Custom parts

We can also 3D print stuff if u want <br>
Note that this will be printed out of plastic so will be weaker than metal parts (very unchadly) <br>
A 3d printer prints by layers, so be sure not to print on air cuz that is not cash money. <br>
DM design/fabrication leads for more info fr 

## Motors

Motors are used to turn stuff and make stuff move its really cool <br>
For drivetrain, we use [TalonFX Kraken X60 Motors](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/kraken-x60/). it is brushless and very fast. <br>
For other moving things, we use the [TalonFX Falcon 500 Motors](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/falcon-500-powered-by-talon-fx/). it is also very fast and silly <br>
Rememebr that u need to wire the thing, so don't put it in too tight pls <br>
Our swerve drive is from [Swerve Drive Specialties](https://www.swervedrivespecialties.com/products/mk4i-swerve-module?variant=47316033896749)

## Other parts n stuff

We can get our parts from anywhere, but here are some places to start. 
1. [West Coast Products](https://wcproducts.com) - good for belts, chains, sprocket n stuff
2. [Andymark](https://www.andymark.com) - cool place for intake wheels, sprockets? idk
3. [RevRobotics](https://www.revrobotics.com/ion-system/) - robotics site idk ive never used it but i heard its useful
4. [McMasterCarr](https://www.mcmaster.com) - godly site for screws, nuts, pins, etc. model all the bolts and nuts if you are chadly enough. Very useful, it has insert function in Fusion, which is in the top right dropdown. Beware of the McMasterTax though. 

## Closing Thoughts

Message the guy who keeps the bot to buy stuff n remember to keep it lesss than 600 pls <br>
Here is the [required electronics document](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/_images/frc-control-system-layout-rev.svg), remember to incorporate this into the bot. <br>
Feel free to message the design or fabrication lead for more info, they are very silly and would love to help you. <br>
